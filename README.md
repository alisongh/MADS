## MADS Course review:
### SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist
* Medium workload
* Reading and writing intensive
* No coding
* Must-have course for the beginner of Data Science which provides a great deal of knowledge and common sense about Data Science in academic and professional espects. There're a plenty of readings, including articles, news, videos and podcasts, requiring you read and watch and reflect on them carefully and profoundly. It requires the student a high level of time management, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It builds up the mindset structure of being a Data Scientist which is not just coding and coding. I have learned so much from readings and interviews and really love this course. You can’t build a house without blueprints. Same as the data science project. It is important to have a clear understanding of the project we’re working on before we start hitting the keyboard. When I started to study Python by myself last year, I mostly liked hard-coding when I was having trouble with cleaning data. Now, when I am facing the same problems collecting and cleaning data again, I try to look for a way of coding to fix the problem instead of manipulating data manually which is meaningless and a waste of time.


### SIADS 505: Data Manipulation
* Medium/heavey worklaod
* Coding intensive (Python; pandas)

### SIADS 502 Math Method for Data Science
* Light/medium workload
* Light reading and writing
* Light coding (Python; numPy)
* Linear Algebra and Statistics
* Disordered course structure with many mistakes and errors in lectures and materials. The instructor doesn't really know what students' academic mathematical level. The lectures for profound math background students are too shallow, but for limited math background students are too difficult. Four assignments are not related to Python coding and two writing assignments are confused without effective grade criterias or samples. It is impossible to have the only math course to satisfy all aspects of academic needs. The female instructor just reads PPTs word by word which is unbearable at all.

### SIADS 522 Information Visualization I
* Heavy workload
* Coding intensive (Python; Altair; pandas)
